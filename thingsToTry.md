Below is a list of some potential features to add to Ravenous:

Make addresses clickable and have them open the address in Google Maps in a new tab
Make images clickable and have them open the business' website in a new tab
Clicking on a different sorting option automatically requeries the Yelp API, rather than having to manually click "Let's Go" again
Implement your own type of sort (for example, by entering a distance or radius from a central location)
Allow you to search by pressing "Enter" (or "Return") on your keyboard, as opposed to manually clicking
Add autocompletion of addresses to the "Location" input
